        <h2>The Full Bill</h2>

        <div class="bill-container">
            <div class="bill-title">A Resolution to Suspend Turkey’s Veto Power in NATO</div>

            <p>WHEREAS, Turkey threatens to exploit their veto power;</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, It is hindering NATO’s ethics and effectiveness;</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, There’s been numerous examples of Turkey blocking NATO actions for leverage;</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, They haven’t been held accountable for several abuses against the Kurdish people and being an untrustworthy ally;</p>
            <p>RESOLVED, That the Congress here assembled recommends the suspension of Turkey’s VETO power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="explanation">
            <strong>Explanation of the Bill:</strong>
            <p><strong>WHEREAS, Turkey threatens to exploit their veto power:</strong> This clause accuses Turkey of using their veto power in NATO for self-serving purposes, rather than for the collective good of the alliance. By doing so, they threaten the unity and effectiveness of NATO's decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>WHEREAS, It is hindering NATO’s ethics and effectiveness:</strong> This clause highlights how Turkey's actions undermine the ethical and operational standards of NATO. The misuse of veto power hampers NATO's ability to uphold democratic values and ensure collective security.</p>

            <p><strong>WHEREAS, There’s been numerous examples of Turkey blocking NATO actions for leverage:</strong> This section provides evidence of Turkey’s repeated obstruction within NATO, using their veto to stall key decisions on sanctions, military actions, and other important initiatives, thus weakening the alliance.</p>

            <p><strong>WHEREAS, They haven’t been held accountable for several abuses against the Kurdish people and being an untrustworthy ally:</strong> Here, Turkey's human rights abuses, particularly against the Kurdish population, are introduced as a significant issue that has gone unaddressed. The bill implies that such behavior contradicts the core values of NATO, making Turkey an unreliable ally.</p>

            <p><strong>RESOLVED, That the Congress here assembled recommends the suspension of Turkey’s VETO power:</strong> The bill concludes with a clear recommendation to suspend Turkey’s veto power, arguing that this step will protect NATO’s ability to act cohesively in the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tips-container">
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When discussing this bill, focus on Turkey’s misuse of veto power and how it undermines the collective interests of NATO. Use examples of Turkey's actions to strengthen your argument.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How I Address These Points in My Speech</h2>

        <div class="speech-container">
            <p>If you name any NATO policy, I can guarantee you Turkey has found a way to violate it. This is not a case of a few mistakes or misunderstandings—it’s a pattern of deliberate defiance. Turkey is no longer a reliable ally but a rogue actor working against the very values NATO was built to defend. It’s time we recognize the reality: Turkey no longer belongs in NATO.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight-text">"Turkey is no longer a reliable ally but a rogue actor working against the very values NATO was built to defend."</span></p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <p>This phrase paints Turkey as not just a problematic member of NATO but as an entity working against the alliance’s core values. By using the phrase "rogue actor," you're emphasizing that Turkey is an outlier, destabilizing NATO from within. This sets the tone for the rest of the speech by making the issue sound urgent and severe.</p>
            </div>

            <p>At its heart, NATO is more than just a military alliance. It’s a partnership built on shared values: democracy, collective defense, and a commitment to peace. But Turkey under President Erdogan has strayed far from these principles. Let’s be clear—this is not just a shift in priorities, it’s a total betrayal of the values we stand for.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight-text">"Turkey under President Erdogan has strayed far from these principles."</span></p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <p>By directly pointing at Turkey’s leadership under President Erdogan, you are personalizing the issue. It’s not an attack on the Turkish people, but rather on the decisions of their leadership. This makes the speech more targeted and avoids alienating people who might feel a connection to Turkey, while clearly identifying the source of the problem.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Take democracy, for instance. The Washington Treaty, NATO’s founding document, binds us to uphold democratic institutions. But under Erdogan’s rule, Turkey has slid into authoritarianism. In 2023, the <strong>Economist Intelligence Unit</strong> ranked Turkey 103rd globally in democracy, calling it a "hybrid regime." In 2022, <strong>Freedom House</strong> labeled Turkey “Not Free,” citing Erdogan’s stranglehold on the press and his rigging of elections. How can we sit here and continue to claim we are a united alliance of democracies when one of our own members is actively dismantling democracy within its borders?</p>

            <p><span class="highlight-text">"How can we sit here and continue to claim we are a united alliance of democracies when one of our own members is actively dismantling democracy within its borders?"</span></p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <p>This rhetorical question directly challenges the audience to confront the contradiction between NATO’s stated values and Turkey’s authoritarian behavior. It’s a strategic way to force listeners to question how long they can tolerate Turkey’s anti-democratic actions while still calling themselves part of a democratic alliance.</p>
            </div>

            <p>But democracy isn’t the only value Turkey has thrown aside. Let’s talk about collective defense—NATO’s core principle. Turkey’s reckless decision to buy Russia’s S-400 missile system in 2019 wasn’t just a breach of trust—it was a direct threat to NATO’s security. According to the <strong>Atlantic Council</strong>, this move jeopardizes the entire alliance by making our shared defense systems vulnerable to Russia’s prying eyes. Turkey isn’t just undermining NATO’s defense strategy; it’s actively compromising our safety.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight-text">"Turkey’s reckless decision to buy Russia’s S-400 missile system in 2019 wasn’t just a breach of trust—it was a direct threat to NATO’s security."</span></p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <p>This line raises the stakes from a diplomatic disagreement to a security threat. By framing the purchase of Russia’s S-400 as a "direct threat," you make the issue not just about internal politics but about the safety of the entire NATO alliance. This helps reinforce why immediate action is necessary.</p>
            </div>

            <p>And it gets worse. In 2019, Turkey launched a military invasion of northern Syria without consulting NATO. This reckless action targeted Kurdish forces—our allies in the fight against ISIS—creating chaos and instability in the region. According to <strong>Human Rights Watch</strong>, Turkey’s actions displaced over 200,000 civilians and fueled human rights abuses. How can Turkey claim to be a NATO ally when it’s attacking the very people who fought alongside us against terrorism?</p>

            <p><span class="highlight-text">"Turkey’s actions displaced over 200,000 civilians and fueled human rights abuses."</span></p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <p>Here, you use specific statistics and human rights violations to appeal to the emotional and moral sensibilities of the audience. By mentioning 200,000 displaced civilians, you make the issue not only about geopolitics but also about human suffering, which resonates deeply with the audience and strengthens your case for action.</p>
            </div>

            <p>We’ve given Turkey chances to change. Over and over, they’ve made promises to NATO—promises to uphold democracy, promises to reconsider their alliance with Russia. And time and again, Turkey has broken those promises. After being warned about the risks of their S-400 deal, Turkey assured us it would realign with NATO’s interests. Instead, they pushed forward, doubling down on their partnership with Russia. This is not the behavior of a trustworthy ally—it’s the behavior of a nation that cannot be relied upon.</p>

            <p>Turkey has had its chance. It’s time we take a stand. By keeping Turkey in NATO, we aren’t just compromising our security—we are compromising our principles. We cannot allow one member to tear apart what the rest of us work so hard to protect.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight-text">"By keeping Turkey in NATO, we aren’t just compromising our security—we are compromising our principles."</span></p>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                <p>This sentence frames the debate not just as a security concern but also as a matter of ethical integrity. By arguing that NATO is compromising its principles by keeping Turkey in the alliance, you make it clear that the issue is about more than just defense; it’s about the core values of the organization.</p>
            </div>

            <p>NATO is at a crossroads. Do we stand by our values or do we let them be eroded from within? Turkey has made its choice—it’s time we make ours. Removing Turkey from NATO is not just the right decision; it’s the necessary one. We need to protect this alliance and the values that bind us together, or risk losing everything we’ve built. The time for action is now.</p>
